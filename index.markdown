With Clip Creator you will be able to quickly process deposition designations through manual entry, by importing preformated files, or clipboard polling.  Each designation will also go through a series of validation checks which will trap invalid ranges.  Some of these include:

> - Negative length clips: End point is before before start point (10:12 through 10:05)
> - Subset clips: Designation appears inside a previous designation
> - Superset clips: Designation encompasses a previous designation
> - Overlapping clips: Designation starts or stops in the middle of a previous designation 
> - Duplicate clips

In these instances Clip Creator will prompt you with a several of options to either resolve or ignore the errors.

Clip Creator offers a variety of export formats making it an invaluable tool no matter what trial presentation system you are using: TrialDirector, TrialMax, or Sanction.
