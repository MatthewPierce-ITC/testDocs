### Welcome to Clip Creator 3.0!
<br>

With Clip Creator you will be able to quickly process deposition designations via manual entry, importing preformated files, or clipboard polling. 

The manual entry method is designed for use with your keyboard's 10-key pad, allowing the user to 
move from one field to the next by hitting the Enter key. Each successive entry will be checked to trap any typos which may result in invalid ranges.


Clip Creator 3.0 will trap a wide variety of designation errors that are usually not realized until after you import the clips into your presentation system. Some of these include:

- Negative length clips: End set before beginning
- Subset clips: Designation appears inside a previous designation
- Superset clips: Designation encompasses a previous designation
- Overlapping clips: Designation starts or stops in the middle of a previous designation 
- Duplicate Clip IDâ€™s

In these instances Clip Creator will prompt you with a variety of options that will allow you to either  resolve or ignore the errors.

Additionally, Clip Creator supports a variety of export formats making it an invaluable tool no matter what presentation system you are using.
