### Append to Previous

With the TrialDirectorÂ® format selected, you have the option to Append a given clip to the previous one.  If you have created clips that you wish to format this way, click the check box in the data grid for the clip you want to append and then select Rebuild.

There are also times where all clips need to be played back-to-back.  Via the right-click menu on the data grid, you may select Append All, which will check all save for the first clip in the population.  Then a Rebuild will update your clips.  Conversly, you may select Append None to clear all append requests.
