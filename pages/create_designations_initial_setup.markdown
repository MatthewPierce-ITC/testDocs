### Initial Setup

First, select the format in which you will be saving the clips. TrialDirector® Clip Creation Script (.ccs), Sanction® Clip List (.txt), Tab Delimited or Comma Separated Values (.csv). 

> ![Screen Grab - Format Selection](../assets/ui_menu_settings_cropped.png)

This selection is optional at this point.  At any time you can change the format selection, and Clip Creator will reformat the clips for you. No work lost, no headache.

At this point you should enter the deposition date and the deponent's name.  This will be used in the AutoID feature and to generate the filename when the work is saved.

Selecting the Line Separator checkbox allows you to add another delimiter in the Auto ID that is generated for each clip.  This is completely optional.

The Lines Per Page number refers to the deposion transcript itself.  Generally this value is 25, but there are times when the court reporters may use something that differs from the standard.  Clip Creator uses this value to validate the clips as they are processed and alerting the user to potential errors.

The Descriptions checkbox enables the user to enter values for such on a clip-by-clip basis.  By clicking the Sticky checkbox, this enterd value is automatically added to each successive clip that is made.
