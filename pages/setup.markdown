### Deposition Information

The deposition date and deponent name will be used to generate the filename when exporting clips. Additionally, if you are using the Auto ID feature, the deponentâ€™s initials  will be automatically pulled as you type.

### Auto ID

As you type the First and Last name of the deponent, their initials will be placed in the Clip ID prefix field. You may manually add a separator after the initials, or overwrite them completely. An optional line separator may be added as well. 

Page padding is limited to two, three and four. Line padding, optional as well, may be added. The "Replicate in ID" checkbox must be checked for the padding selections to be utilized.  The auto-generated ID will build in the Clip ID field as entries are made in the Start Page and Line boxes.

### Descriptions

Descriptions for clips may be entered on a clip-by clip basis by enabling the Descriptions field with the checkbox on the far left.

The Sticky checkbox that appears under the Description field will cause all subsequent clips to inherit the same description as they are keyed into the program.
