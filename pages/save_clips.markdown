### Saving Clips

Once all of the clips have been made and validated, they can be saved for import into your presentation system.  This can be done via File > Save on the menu, or the Save button.

Clip Creator takes the deponent information (Name, Date, Volume) and creates a filename for you, to help with orginazation.
