### Manual Entry

The manual mode is designed to minimize hand movement across the keyboard. The cursor will advance from one field to the next when you hit the Enter key. You may also use the backspace key to move backwards through all of the Page/Line boxes should you need to make a correction.

If you are using the TrialDirectorÂ® format, you are given the additional option to append the clip to the 
previous entry for a multiple segment clip as seen here:

With each completed entry, Clip Creator will generate the required entry in the Clips window and in the data grid at the bottom of the application. The data grid has special features for modifying the clips once they are entered into the application.  See Modifying Clips for more details.
