### Edit Descriptions

If you wish to change the descriptions on some or all of the clips that have been made, do so by clicking on the Description cell for each entry in the data grid

If you would like to do a global replacement of **all** descriptions in the clip population, enter your new description in the Description field.  Then, right-click on the data grid and select Update Descriptions from the displayed options.

After the values in the data grid are changed, click the Rebuild button to update your clips in the Clips window.
