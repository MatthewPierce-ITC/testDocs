### Creating Clips

Designations can be created in one of three ways:

1. **Manual Entry** - Keying in each individual clip, utilizing Clip Creator's validation and formatting methods
2. **Text File Import** - Validate and build an import file for your presentation program of choice from an existing list of designations.
3. **Clipboard Polling** - Review an existing document for clip citations and use Clip Creator to automate the extraction and building of validated clips.
