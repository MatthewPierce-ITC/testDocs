### Modify Existing Designations

Once clips have been entered, validated, and formatted with Clip Creator, you may wish to make changes to some of the content and formatting.  The ranges, IDs, Descriptions, and formatting of any existing clip can be modified in the data grid by clicking on the desired cell and changing the content.  Once this has been done, click the Rebuild button to update the Clips window with the new values.

There are several automated features available to modify existing designations that can be accessed via the right-click menu on the data grid.
